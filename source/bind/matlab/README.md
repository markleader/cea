CEA MATLAB Binding
==================
This MATLAB interface exists but has not been heavily tested or maintained.
It likely needs additional work before it is production-ready.

Recommended approach:
- Use the Python binding from MATLAB (e.g., `py.importlib.import_module('cea')`)
  to access the supported API.

If you need a native MATLAB interface, please open an issue or contribute fixes.

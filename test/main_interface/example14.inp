!  EXAMPLE 14:
!     (a)  Output from this case is used 1) to illustrate the effect of
!          condensed species on volume and molecular weight (see sec.2.2,part I)
!     (b)  Assigned-temperature-and-pressure problem (tp).
!     (c)  Reactants are H2(L) and O2(L) and amounts are specified in moles.
!     (d)  The "exploded" formulas are given to save the program looking them
!          up.  Reactant enthalpies are not needed for assigned temperature
!          problems.
!     (e)  Assigned pressure in atmospheres is p,atm =.05.
!     (f)  Assigned temperatures in kelvin are t,k =1000,500,351,305,304.3,
!          304, 300.
!     (g)  Print intermediate output for the fifth point with debug = 5.

!  EXAMPLE 6:
!     (a)  Chapman-Jouguet detonation problem (detonation)
!     (b)  The reactants are H2 and O2 gases.  The mixture is
!          stoichiometric (r,e=1).
!     (c)  The unburned gases are at 298.15 and 500 K and pressures
!          1 bar and 30 bars (t,k=298.15,500, pbar=1,30)
!     (d)  Thermal transport properties are called for (transport).
!     (e)  Energy units in the final tables are in calories (calories).

reac  oxid O2  wt%=100
      fuel H2  wt%=100.

 prob  detonation   case=6  t=298.15,500, r,e=1, pbar=1,20

output  calories transport
